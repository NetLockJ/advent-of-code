## 2015 
- Languages: Python
- Working on for practice for 2023 AoC

---

## 2022
- Languages: Java
- Days 1-11 (not part 2 on 7)
- Files are solutions to part 2, I didn't make them separate files so it's a bit confusing

## 2023 
- Languages: Python/Java
- Days 1-20 (Not 17, 12 & 19 part 1 only) and 24 part 1
- A couple days without part 2 solved still have code, it won't work, but it's there

## 2024
- Languages Python
- Days 1-15 (Not 6, 12, 15, part 1 only), 17-19, 22-25 (22, 24, 25 part 1 only)
